**Prior Research** - I picked these components to keep the rocket powerful, reliable, and affordable, all within the $350 limit. The potassium nitrate and dextrose composite propellant gives a strong, steady, and stable thrust that is safe to work with. I chose aluminum for the airframe and will 3D print the nose cone and fins using ABS for the nose cone, and PETG for the fins, since they’re lightweight but tough. The graphite nozzle handles high heat (3000C) , and the GPS and altimeter (altitude measuring device) will help me track the rocket’s flight and safely recover it. Everything I chose has a clear purpose and helps show that I have a deep understanding of how to design and build something this complex.
